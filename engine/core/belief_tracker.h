// Observer's memory of a game in progress.
//
// Design principle: the tracker's inputs come SOLELY through this
// interface — initial observations at session start, then public events
// for each action. It never receives a reference to the game state for
// reading (randomize_unseen takes a state for WRITING only). This mirrors
// the AI API contract: a tracker running behind an AI/player boundary
// could be driven by action_ids + event payloads over the wire.
//
// Concretely, this means:
//   - observe_public_event MUST update internal belief from the given
//     payloads — no peeking at truth or any other state.
//   - init is driven by initial_observation (not state); the game's
//     initial_observation_extractor produces observer-visible starting
//     info (own hand, public tableau, etc.).
//   - Tracker implementations are typed per game; they use their internal
//     belief state plus event payloads to answer encoder queries.
//
// Enforced by tests:
//   - test_api_belief_matches_selfplay — a tracker initialized with a
//     different seed than ground truth must converge to the same belief
//     after replaying the observation stream. Any hidden state read would
//     diverge.
//   - test_api_mcts_policy_invariance — MCTS policy depending on tracker
//     belief must be identical across selfplay and API paths.
