"""AI API belief-equivalence: a self-play-generated observation trace must
drive an independent API session to the SAME belief as self-play's own
tracker, step by step.

This is the strongest test of the AI/state separation invariant:
- Ground truth (self-play) runs with one seed, maintains its own belief
  tracker dedicated to a chosen perspective, and records the per-ply
  observation stream (pre/post events + belief snapshot after).
- The API-side session starts with a DIFFERENT seed — its internal
  randomized hidden state does not match ground truth.
- We then replay the observation stream into the API session and assert
  the API's belief tracker matches ground truth's, every step.

If the API's belief diverges, either the event schema is incomplete (some
public info never reaches the API) or apply_event is wrong. Either way,
the separation invariant is broken.

For deterministic games (tictactoe, quoridor), belief is trivially empty
and this test mostly checks that public state stays consistent under the
independent-seed replay.
