"""Hasher avalanche quality (BUG-026 fix regression).

The engine's `state_hash_for_perspective(p)` feeds `Hasher::combine` in a
specific sequence. Structural collisions (similar inputs → similar outputs)
cause DAG nodes to erroneously share in MCTS. We can't directly test the
C++ Hasher class from Python, but we CAN test the observable invariant:
two states that differ in hashed fields must produce different values of
`state_hash_for_perspective` — and across a large sample of perturbations,
the output should be uniformly distributed.

Method: run many `encode_state` calls across seeds and record the implicit
hash via `dinoboard_engine.state_hash_for_perspective` bindings if
available; otherwise probe structural quality via selfplay `dag_reuse_hits`
— the ratio should stabilize near a game-specific equilibrium rather than
spike (spike = too many false reuses = collisions).

This test is BEHAVIORAL (stats over many trials) not exhaustive. It catches
the Love Letter 2p + dirichlet regime that triggered BUG-026 originally.
