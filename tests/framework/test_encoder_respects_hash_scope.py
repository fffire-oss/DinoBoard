"""Regression: feature encoder respects the public/private partition.

The ISMCTS architecture aligns encoder scope with the hash scope:
encoder must only extract features from (public_fields + current
player's private_fields). Opponents' private fields must NOT influence
encoder output.

This is the structural enforcement of "no info leak through features":
- Hash groups sampled worlds by info set → multiple worlds share tree nodes
- Encoder must produce the SAME feature vector for all worlds in the info set
- Otherwise the network sees different features across sampled worlds at
  the same tree node, and its prior/value estimates become world-specific
  rather than info-set-specific → prior pollution under root sampling

Test method: for each hidden-info game, construct two states that differ
ONLY in opp private fields. Encoder output must be bit-identical.

If this test fails, either:
- The encoder is reading opp private (info leak)
- The game's hash_private_fields declaration is wrong (wrong partition)

Either way, we want to know.
