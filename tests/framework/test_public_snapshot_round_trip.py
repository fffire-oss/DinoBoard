"""public_state_applier must be an exact inverse of the snapshot extractor
at the hash level.

For every game that registers a `public_state_applier`:

  truth state → extractor populates `public_snapshot` in trace step
  blank observer session + apply_initial_observation(perspective)
    + apply that snapshot via apply_public_snapshot
  → observer.state_hash_for_perspective(perspective)
    MUST equal truth.state_hash_for_perspective(perspective) for every
    perspective.

If this fails, the applier has drifted from `hash_public_fields` and the
observer's public view no longer matches truth — which is the same
class of silent public-state drift as BUG-028.

Note: this test uses the direct `apply_public_snapshot` binding to
isolate the applier's correctness from `apply_observation`'s full flow.
End-to-end invocation through `apply_observation` is covered by
`test_api_belief_matches_selfplay` and `test_public_hash_excludes_internal_rng`.
