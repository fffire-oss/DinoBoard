"""ISMCTS info-leak regression: MCTS policy must be identical across
GameSession (truth-driven) and AI-API (observation-driven) paths.

If GameSession MCTS secretly reads `bundle_->state`'s hidden fields
(opponent hand, blind-reserved card IDs, etc.), its policy output will
differ from an AI-API session that only knows what a real observer
would see — because the latter has no access to truth. This test
constructs both paths on top of the same observation history and
asserts their MCTS policies at the perspective player's turn agree.

The selfplay episode records its own MCTS visit distribution per ply
(via `trace_perspective`). The API session then replays the same
observation trace and queries `get_ai_action` at the corresponding
ply. Policies should match up to MCTS RNG noise (which we bound by
requiring the argmax action to agree and the total variation distance
between distributions to stay under a threshold).

Covers Love Letter (bluff-heavy hidden hand) and Splendor (blind-
reserved card opacity). If the leak regresses, this test fails well
before user-visible "AI too smart" symptoms.
