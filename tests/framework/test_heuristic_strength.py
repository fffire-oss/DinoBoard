"""Heuristic strength regression: Azul and Splendor heuristics should
dominate a uniform-random picker.

Motivation: the heuristic_picker is used for the web UI "heuristic"
difficulty and as a baseline in benchmark eval. If someone refactors
the heuristic and accidentally breaks scoring logic, it might still
produce legal actions but play no better than random — silently turning
the "heuristic" difficulty into a trivially-weak baseline. This test
catches that by running head-to-head selfplay where one side uses the
registered heuristic_picker and the other picks uniformly.

For simple games (TicTacToe 9 moves, tree fully searchable), random vs
heuristic is close to 50/50. For Quoridor/LoveLetter/Coup we already
trust the registered picker. The HIGH-SIGNAL games for this regression
are Azul and Splendor where we just wrote non-trivial heuristics.
