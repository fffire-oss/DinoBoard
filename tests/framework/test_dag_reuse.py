"""Regression: MCTS DAG node reuse is actually happening.

ISMCTS keys MCTS nodes by (public + current_player_private + step_count).
When the same decision state is reachable via different action orderings
(transpositions) OR via different sampled worlds that converge to the same
info set, those descents MUST share a tree node via the global hash→
node_index table.

If DAG reuse were broken (e.g. every sim creates independent subtrees),
expanded_nodes / simulations_done would be ~1.0 (no sharing).
Healthy ISMCTS with DAG should show ratio < 1.0 for hidden-info games
because observer-info-set sharing is the point.

This test uses the `dag_reuse_hits` stat exposed in NetMctsStats to
assert reuse is nonzero for games where it should happen.

DAG acyclicity is ALSO validated implicitly: if the DAG had cycles,
MCTS would either loop forever or (with max_depth) generate an inflated
tree. Max_depth-bounded non-looping behavior is its own sanity check.
