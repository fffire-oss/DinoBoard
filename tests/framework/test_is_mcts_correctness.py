"""Deep correctness tests for Information Set MCTS (IS-MCTS) and belief trackers.

These tests verify the fundamental invariant: AI decisions must never depend on
hidden information that the perspective player cannot observe.

Test approach:
1. Play the same game with different hidden state but identical observations
   → AI must make the same decision (it can't tell them apart)
2. Verify that randomize_unseen produces states where opponents have different
   cards than the original (proving it's not copying hidden state)
3. Verify that the encoder output is identical for two states that differ only
   in truly hidden information
4. Verify that the belief tracker correctly updates known_hand from observations
