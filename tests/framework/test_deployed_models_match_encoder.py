"""Regression: deployed ONNX models in games/<name>/model/ must match the
CURRENT encoder's feature_dim.

Motivation: silent staleness. If an encoder gains a feature dim (e.g. new
`first_player` indicator in TicTacToe) but the deployed model on disk was
trained under the old dim, ONNX evaluator throws at runtime — pipelines
show "thinking" forever, users see no AI move, no clear error in UI.

This test catches that at CI time by loading each deployed model through
onnxruntime and asserting the input shape matches `game_metadata.feature_dim`.
