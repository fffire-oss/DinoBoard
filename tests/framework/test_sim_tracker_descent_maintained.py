"""Sim-local tracker is maintained during MCTS descent.

Per SIM_TRACKER_DESCENT_PLAN: each MCTS sim clones the session-shared
tracker at sim entry, calls randomize_unseen, and during descent feeds
`observe_public_event` after every `do_action_fast` so deep nodes'
encoder reads see up-to-date public-derived state. This test asserts
that maintenance actually happens — i.e. the cloned sim_tracker
diverges from the session-shared root tracker as descent progresses.

Coverage = games_with_capability("tracker") MINUS LL (LL serialize() is
stateless so this test cannot detect descent-time changes there; LL's
maintenance is exercised indirectly via test_api_belief_matches_selfplay
and the sim's encoder reading the cloned tracker). Currently resolves
to Splendor only; Coup re-entering the manifest will gain coverage.
