"""Regression: IBeliefTracker's serialize() is deterministic.

The stronger "tracker never reads ground-truth hidden state" invariant is
covered by `test_api_belief_matches_selfplay` — that test drives an API
session with an INDEPENDENT seed through the observation stream produced
by selfplay, and asserts the tracker's serialized belief matches at every
ply. That's a real equivalence check.

Historically this file also contained a
`test_tracker_belief_invariant_under_seed_shuffle` that attempted to drive
two differently-seeded sessions through the SAME action-id sequence.
That design didn't work: different seeds produce different public state
(e.g. Splendor's initial tableau), so the first few actions legal in
session A are usually not legal in session B, and the test skipped
nearly 100% of the time. Deleted — `test_api_belief_matches_selfplay`
covers the same invariant correctly.
