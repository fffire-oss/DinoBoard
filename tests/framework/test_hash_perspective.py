"""I14 (golden standard): state_hash_for_perspective contract.

Two invariants pinned here, complementing test_public_hash_excludes_internal_rng
(which checks the public-derivable property across different sessions):

  (1) Determinism — for any registered game, two GameSession objects
      constructed with the same seed produce byte-equal
      state_hash_for_perspective(p) for every perspective p, both at the
      initial state and after the same first legal action driven by
      apply_observation. Catches accidental dependence on object address,
      uninitialized memory, or wall-clock RNG.

  (2) Fully-public games have perspective-invariant hash — for tictactoe
      and quoridor, state_hash_for_perspective(p) is identical across
      every p (no private fields → public hash is the whole hash).
      Hidden-info games are NOT required to satisfy this — different
      perspectives see different private cards, so their hashes legally
      differ.

Together these pin the framework-derived hash contract: same observation
history → same hash, regardless of session RNG; fully-public game → same
hash for every viewer.
