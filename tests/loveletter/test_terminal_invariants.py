"""Regression: Love Letter must never deadlock with alive<=1 and terminal=false.

The concern (from audit): if two or more players are eliminated within a
single decision cascade, `sole_survivor` returns -1 (zero survivors) and
`check_end_game` does nothing unless the deck is empty — game would deadlock
with `current_player` pointing at a dead player, `legal_actions` empty, and
`is_terminal=false`.

The rules we checked (Guard / Baron / Prince / King) all eliminate at most
ONE player per action — simultaneous double-elimination is not reachable
from any single `do_action_fast` call. This test hammers 3p/4p selfplay
and GameSession stepping to verify: after EVERY action, the state must
satisfy one of:
  - `is_terminal=true` (game over; winner might be -1 for a draw)
  - alive count >= 1 AND current_player points at an alive player
