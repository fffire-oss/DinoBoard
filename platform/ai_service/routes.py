"""AI API routes. Contract: no game state crosses this boundary.

Endpoints:
  POST /ai/sessions              — create a session, returns session_id
  POST /ai/sessions/{id}/observe — record an action the AI observed
  POST /ai/sessions/{id}/decide  — ask the AI for its next action
  DELETE /ai/sessions/{id}       — close a session
  GET /ai/sessions/{id}          — status (actions observed, turn, terminal)

Snapshot-path games (splendor / loveletter / coup carry hidden info +
trackers; azul is fully public but still uses the snapshot protocol)
require the caller to pass `events` and `public_snapshot` on every
observe call so the AI's belief tracker (where present) stays consistent
with truth and the session's public state is rebuilt from the wire — the
action_id alone is not enough. Fully-public no-tracker games
(tictactoe / quoridor) only need `action_id`.

AI strength is server-controlled — `simulations` / `temperature` /
`opponent_selection` are not wire fields. Clients may choose only the coarse
`strength` alias; the server resolves it per-game against approved web
profiles in the unified config (selfplay / arena / eval in `game.json`;
web_expert / web_balanced / web_casual / analysis in `web.json`); see
`training/mcts_profile.py` and
`docs/guide/CONFIG_REFERENCE.md`. `seed` is optional; omitting it lets the
server pick a fresh `secrets.randbits(64)` value, which is the default for
production clients. Tests may pass an explicit `seed` for reproducibility.
